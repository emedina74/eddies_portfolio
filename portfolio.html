<p>This game Zombie Warfare was designed in scratch as a project for our AP CSP class. 
This experience was very fun and a new experience. I am a long time video gmame player and 
it was a new experience to actually create my own game. My group hit some speed bumps while making 
this game but, we overcame them and created a really fun and creative game. My game had a logiocal and 
mathmatical algorithm in it. In which the main character can move in a ny direction but, when touching another 
object it would signal game over. This algorithm had both math and logic in it. If i were to go back and fix it I
would add shooting to the game. This would take more algorithms which, after making this game I understand more and 
I feel my group and I would be able to achieve it.</p>
